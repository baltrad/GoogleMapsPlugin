This is a modified version of the Google Maps weather radar viewer
created by Petr Novak, CHMI (http://www.chmi.cz, petr_novak@chmi.cz)
and Lukas Ronge, A.S.S.  (http://www.bourky.com, ronge.lukas@gmail.com
for use by EUMETNET-OPERA community.

This version was made by Thomas Boevith (thb@dmi.dk), Danish
Meteorological Institute (DMI) to display data from the BALTRAD
community. Extensions to the original version are: multiple products
support, selection of date, and on/off button.

Included in this version is demo data from DMI as well as the Swedish
Meteorological and Hydrological Institute (SHMI).

Please substitue the apikey with your own key in line 22 of index.php
and see the README file for further information.
