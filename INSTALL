GOOGLE MAPS PLUGIN FOR RAVE

This is a plugin intended for rave. It generates google map compatible
png-files and also the necessary infrastructure to be able to view
the products in google map.

The installation is straightforward, just type 
python setup.py install --prefix=<somewhere>.

The configuration is a bit trickier. First of all you need to define what areas
you will support. This is done by defining an xml file containing the wanted products,
see web/smhi-areas.xml.

Next step is to generate a java script file that will be loaded by the browsers.

%> python src/GenerateProductInfo.py <xml-file>

You will get a file called products.js as a result, copy this file into
the web/ directory.

All data files are expected to be placed in web/data/<prod>/year/month/day so
if something is not working, verify that the files are placed in there.
